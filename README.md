# Bash-Development

Following bash scripts are used to automate some initalization and installtions associated with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)

We will use the [WP CLI](https://wp-cli.org/de/) to make things even simpler.

In addition some functionalities of these scripts depend on a MacOS environment and a running [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/de/mamp/mac/) server.
